# CatOrCap
Built a cat classifier using Pytorch and a) Simple Neural Network  b) Convolutional Neural Network to compare the two techniques.
The training and test dataset has been taken from Course 1 of the DL specialization offered by Andrew Ng.

Modules used:
h5py (to extract data from the .h5 files)
PyTorch (to construct and implement the Models)
MatPlotLib to plot some images.
